      <p>So on September 28th, it was your fabulous birthday! Happy Happy Birthday! Being in your twenties in my opinion changes your perspective a lot. You're no longer a teenager and you're definitely closer to being a true adult.
      It has been so great getting to know you over this past month. We haven't been able to really see each other that often recently but this definitely won't be the norm (sorryz I've been a complete hermit due to classes).
