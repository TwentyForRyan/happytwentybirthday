      <p>So on September 28th, it was your fabulous birthday! Happy Happy Birthday! Being in your twenties in my opinion changes your perspective a lot. You're no longer a teenager and you're definitely closer to being a true adult.
      It's been so great getting to know you over this past month and a half. I remember when I first spotted you in our orientation group and just thought how you were super stylish. Rock yo style, gurl. Thanks for stepping in and making my hair purty. It was kind of painful, actually really painful but it's okay. You pulled through and helped out until the end. Heh. We haven't been able to really see each other that often recently but this definitely won't be the norm (sorryz I've been a complete hermit due to classes).
      Once again, happy birthday!
